Mock code for ReplayService

USE CASES***************
Functional Requirements:

Internal Message Broker:

Publish Events:

Use Case: Microservices need to publish various types of events.
Requirement: The broker must allow microservices to publish events to specific topics or channels.
Subscribe to Events:

Use Case: Microservices need to subscribe to events they are interested in.
Requirement: The broker should support subscribing to events based on topic subscriptions.
Message Enrichment:

Use Case: Events should be enriched before publishing.
Requirement: The broker must integrate with the message enrichment engine to transform and enrich events.
Scalable Consumer Groups:

Use Case: Multiple instances of a microservice may consume the same event type.
Requirement: The broker should support scalable consumer groups to distribute events evenly among consumers.
External Message Bus:

High Throughput Messaging:

Use Case: Multiple downstream systems require high throughput for message processing.
Requirement: The message bus must handle high message throughput efficiently.
Message Routing:

Use Case: Different downstream systems have varying message requirements.
Requirement: The message bus should allow routing and filtering of messages to target specific consumers.
Consumer Scaling:

Use Case: Downstream consumers need to scale dynamically based on workload.
Requirement: The message bus should support dynamic scaling of consumers to handle changing message volumes.
Message Acknowledgment:

Use Case: Downstream consumers need to acknowledge successful message processing.
Requirement: The message bus should support acknowledgment mechanisms to ensure message delivery and processing.
Non-Functional Requirements:

Internal Message Broker:

Low Latency:

Use Case: Real-time processing is essential for certain microservices.
Requirement: The broker must provide low-latency event delivery.
Reliability and Durability:

Use Case: Ensure no message loss even in the event of broker or node failures.
Requirement: The broker should support message durability, replication, and fault tolerance.
Message Ordering:

Use Case: Maintaining the order of events is critical for specific business processes.
Requirement: The broker should support ordered message delivery within specific topics or channels.
Security:

Use Case: Protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication.
Requirement: Implement access control, authentication, and encryption features to ensure data security.
External Message Bus:

Scalability:

Use Case: The message bus must handle millions of messages daily.
Requirement: The message bus must be horizontally scalable to accommodate growing event volumes.
Dead Letter Queues:

Use Case: Handle messages that couldn't be delivered to any consumer.
Requirement: Implement dead letter queues to capture undeliverable or unprocessable messages for further analysis.
Backpressure Handling:

Use Case: Prevent overwhelming downstream consumers with too many messages.
Requirement: Implement backpressure mechanisms to control message flow and prevent overload.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Use Case: Continuous monitoring of message delivery and consumer health.
Requirement: Provide monitoring and alerting capabilities to track message delivery, consumer lag, and system health.
Integration with Downstream Systems:

Use Case: Integration with various downstream systems, each with its own protocols.
Requirement: Support multiple integration protocols and formats to accommodate various downstream consumers.



**** KAFKA vs SOLACE

Aspect	Kafka	Solace
