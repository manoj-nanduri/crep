Mock code for ReplayService

USE CASES***************
Internal Event Broker Use Cases and Requirements:

Publish and Subscribe:

Use Case: Microservices need to publish events to notify other microservices about changes or events.
Requirement: The internal event broker must support a publish-subscribe model for efficient communication between microservices.
Event Enrichment:

Use Case: The message enrichment engine enriches events before publishing them.
Requirement: The broker should allow the integration of the enrichment engine to transform and enrich events before they are consumed.
Scalability:

Use Case: As the system grows, it should handle an increasing number of events without performance degradation.
Requirement: The broker must be horizontally scalable to accommodate growing event volumes and consumer demands.
Low Latency:

Use Case: Real-time processing is critical for certain events.
Requirement: The broker must provide low-latency event delivery to support real-time use cases.
Reliability and Durability:

Use Case: Ensure no message loss even in the event of broker or node failures.
Requirement: The broker should support message durability, replication, and fault tolerance.
Message Ordering:

Use Case: Maintaining the order of events is essential for specific business processes.
Requirement: The broker should support ordered message delivery within specific topics or channels.
Security:

Use Case: Protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication.
Requirement: Implement access control, authentication, and encryption features to ensure data security.
Monitoring and Metrics:

Use Case: Continuous monitoring of broker health and performance.
Requirement: Provide comprehensive monitoring and reporting capabilities, including metrics on message throughput, latency, and system health.
Integration with Microservices:

Use Case: Integration with various programming languages and frameworks used by microservices.
Requirement: Provide client libraries and SDKs for different programming languages to facilitate easy integration.
Downstream Message Bus Use Cases and Requirements:

High Throughput:

Use Case: The downstream systems need to process millions of messages efficiently.
Requirement: The message bus must handle high throughput and distribute messages efficiently to downstream consumers.
Message Routing:

Use Case: Different downstream systems have unique message requirements.
Requirement: The message bus should support message routing and filtering to send messages to the appropriate consumers based on their needs.
Consumer Scaling:

Use Case: Scalability for downstream consumers.
Requirement: The message bus should support dynamic scaling of consumers based on workload.
Message Segmentation:

Use Case: Different types of messages may require different handling.
Requirement: Implement message segmentation or tagging to categorize and route messages effectively.
Message Acknowledgment:

Use Case: Downstream consumers need to acknowledge successful message processing.
Requirement: The message bus should support acknowledgment mechanisms to ensure message delivery and processing.
Dead Letter Queues:

Use Case: Handle messages that couldn't be delivered to any consumer.
Requirement: Implement dead letter queues to capture undeliverable or unprocessable messages for further analysis.
Retry Mechanisms:

Use Case: Handle transient failures in downstream systems.
Requirement: Implement message retry mechanisms to handle transient errors in message processing.
Backpressure Handling:

Use Case: Prevent overwhelming downstream consumers with too many messages.
Requirement: Implement backpressure mechanisms to control message flow and prevent overload.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Use Case: Continuous monitoring of message delivery and consumer health.
Requirement: Provide monitoring and alerting capabilities to track message delivery, consumer lag, and system health.
Integration with Downstream Systems:

Use Case: Integration with various downstream systems, each with its own protocols.
Requirement: Support multiple integration protocols and formats to accommodate various downstream consumers.
