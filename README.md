Mock code for ReplayService


PROCESS OUTLINE
Define Requirements and Use Cases:

Clearly define the requirements of your system.
Identify the use cases and scenarios that the system needs to support.
Understand the volume of events, throughput, latency, and scalability requirements.
Select Candidate Technologies:

Research and identify candidate technologies for your internal event broker (pub/sub system) and external message bus.
Consider popular message brokers such as Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Apache Pulsar, and cloud-native solutions like AWS SNS/SQS, Azure Event Hubs, or Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
Evaluate their features, performance, and suitability for your use case.
POC Environment Setup:

Set up a POC environment that mimics your production environment as closely as possible.
Install and configure the selected technologies for both the internal event broker and external message bus.
Message Enrichment Engine:

Develop a simplified version of your message enrichment engine for testing purposes.
Ensure it can consume events from the internal event broker, enrich them, and publish the enriched messages to the external message bus.
Internal Event Broker POC:

Implement a few microservices or components that generate and consume events using the selected internal event broker technology.
Test the performance, scalability, and reliability of the internal event broker for handling internal communication.
External Message Bus POC:

Create downstream consumers that subscribe to messages from the external message bus.
Test the ability of the message bus to handle a high volume of messages and distribute them to the appropriate consumers based on their requirements.
Performance and Scalability Testing:

Measure the performance metrics of both the internal event broker and external message bus under load.
Ensure they meet your throughput and latency requirements.
Fault Tolerance and Reliability:

Introduce failure scenarios and test the fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms of both systems.
Evaluate how well they handle network partitions, node failures, and data consistency.
Monitoring and Logging:

Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track the health and performance of the systems.
Set up alerts and dashboards to detect and respond to issues.
Security and Access Control:

Ensure that both the internal event broker and external message bus have appropriate security mechanisms in place.
Implement access control, authentication, and encryption.


USE CASES***************
Functional Requirements:

Internal Message Broker:

Publish Events:

Use Case: Microservices need to publish various types of events.
Requirement: The broker must allow microservices to publish events to specific topics or channels.
Subscribe to Events:

Use Case: Microservices need to subscribe to events they are interested in.
Requirement: The broker should support subscribing to events based on topic subscriptions.
Message Enrichment:

Use Case: Events should be enriched before publishing.
Requirement: The broker must integrate with the message enrichment engine to transform and enrich events.
Scalable Consumer Groups:

Use Case: Multiple instances of a microservice may consume the same event type.
Requirement: The broker should support scalable consumer groups to distribute events evenly among consumers.
External Message Bus:

High Throughput Messaging:

Use Case: Multiple downstream systems require high throughput for message processing.
Requirement: The message bus must handle high message throughput efficiently.
Message Routing:

Use Case: Different downstream systems have varying message requirements.
Requirement: The message bus should allow routing and filtering of messages to target specific consumers.
Consumer Scaling:

Use Case: Downstream consumers need to scale dynamically based on workload.
Requirement: The message bus should support dynamic scaling of consumers to handle changing message volumes.
Message Acknowledgment:

Use Case: Downstream consumers need to acknowledge successful message processing.
Requirement: The message bus should support acknowledgment mechanisms to ensure message delivery and processing.
Non-Functional Requirements:

Internal Message Broker:

Low Latency:

Use Case: Real-time processing is essential for certain microservices.
Requirement: The broker must provide low-latency event delivery.
Reliability and Durability:

Use Case: Ensure no message loss even in the event of broker or node failures.
Requirement: The broker should support message durability, replication, and fault tolerance.
Message Ordering:

Use Case: Maintaining the order of events is critical for specific business processes.
Requirement: The broker should support ordered message delivery within specific topics or channels.
Security:

Use Case: Protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication.
Requirement: Implement access control, authentication, and encryption features to ensure data security.
External Message Bus:

Scalability:

Use Case: The message bus must handle millions of messages daily.
Requirement: The message bus must be horizontally scalable to accommodate growing event volumes.
Dead Letter Queues:

Use Case: Handle messages that couldn't be delivered to any consumer.
Requirement: Implement dead letter queues to capture undeliverable or unprocessable messages for further analysis.
Backpressure Handling:

Use Case: Prevent overwhelming downstream consumers with too many messages.
Requirement: Implement backpressure mechanisms to control message flow and prevent overload.
Monitoring and Alerting:

Use Case: Continuous monitoring of message delivery and consumer health.
Requirement: Provide monitoring and alerting capabilities to track message delivery, consumer lag, and system health.
Integration with Downstream Systems:

Use Case: Integration with various downstream systems, each with its own protocols.
Requirement: Support multiple integration protocols and formats to accommodate various downstream consumers.
